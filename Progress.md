Well today I did a wonderful job on this website.
I: 
    # designed the recent searches functionality.
    # Redesigned the UI to meet the available data from the API.

I am remaining with:
    # changing the box shadow properties of the navbar when contents are scrolled beneath it.
    # Finally I will make the design more aesthetic and use the color as they used in the figma design file(modules).
    # Organizing my code into easy to handle code files, especially for javascript.
    # push the project to git and github(if I want,lol).

Today Task Queue:
    # Deleting recent searches.
    # Implement a loading functionality when data is not yet available
    # using media queries for mobile screens.
    # organising and commenting the code.
    # using version control(Git).
    # Hosting my website on cloud flare or any other available possibility.
